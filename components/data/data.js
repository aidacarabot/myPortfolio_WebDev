  aboutMe:
    "Hi there! I'm a Junior Full-Stack Developer with a unique background in business and e-commerce. My journey into the world of coding has been an exciting transition from my previous role as a Brand Manager at Amazon. With a Bachelor's degree in Business Administration, I spent several years honing my skills in brand management and e-commerce strategies. During my time at Amazon, I developed a keen interest in the technical aspects of online businesses. This curiosity eventually led me to explore the fascinating world of web development. Driven by my passion for problem-solving and creating innovative solutions, I decided to take a leap and immerse myself in the tech world. I recently completed an intensive Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp, where I gained hands-on experience in both front-end and back-end technologies. This experience has equipped me with a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and various modern frameworks and libraries. What excites me most about coding is the ability to bring ideas to life. I love the challenge of turning concepts into functional, user-friendly applications. My business background gives me a unique perspective on development projects, allowing me to approach problems with both a technical and strategic mindset. As a junior developer, I'm constantly learning and expanding my skill set. While I'm still exploring the vast landscape of web development, I'm particularly intrigued by emerging technologies. Cloud computing, Web3, blockchain, machine learning, and artificial intelligence are areas that fascinate me. I'm excited about the potential of these technologies to shape the future of web development and eager to delve deeper into these fields as I grow in my career. When I'm not coding, you can find me catching waves at the beach. Surfing, like coding, teaches me the value of patience, persistence, and the thrill of mastering new skills. I'm currently seeking opportunities to apply my skills and contribute to innovative web development projects. I'm excited about the possibility of bringing my unique blend of business acumen and technical skills to a dynamic development team. Feel free to explore my portfolio to see some of the projects I've been working on. If you're interested in collaborating or have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out. Let's create something amazing together!",
